# Lab 3 & Final Project
Detailed design:
Design the class item commodity to realize the description of commodity information. 
And design the class staff commodity to realize the description of the staff imformation.

This is a C++ basic Supermarket Management Website System:
● Implemented the supermarket manager can provide functions like add, search, deleting, editing and joining new staff registration. 
● Similar systems mostly use arrays of structures to manipulate data. The system uses a linked list structure to manipulate data, and improved the efficiency of data processing. 
● Save each project information about the project, name, category, price, and quantity in the file system.

The function system including:

1.Class itemMarket()         
Struct the imformation about item

2.Class storeStaff()           
Struct the imformation about store satff 

3.Void itemMarket::input()    
Enter the item imformation to store

4.String searchItem()         
Search the item and availble to show the imformation

5.string newStaff()           
Use the function to change the staff password 

6.Void showMenu()          
Show the menu choice
